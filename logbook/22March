- Fixing "Tensor objects are only iterable when eager execution is"
- Recompiled latest ray
- It should be a list of tensors (I guess), now it is just a single tensor
- Nope. For Acrobot it is also a tensor with shape (?, 3). For ours it is of shape (?, 166).
Acrobot - Tensor("default_1/tower/fc_net/fc_out/BiasAdd:0", shape=(?, 3), dtype=float32)
Ours - Tensor("default/vision_net/Reshape:0", shape=(?, 166), dtype=float32)

- Passed that stage with single categorical.
- For multiple categorical, I think the model structure has to output list of tensors.
- pysc2's flag thing does not work in workers

- Forced pysc2 flag in environment init
- Seems to get stuck after 9 episodes..

23:48
- Switch to using tune
- Now it seems to create environments non-stop..
- Still hangs after a dozen episodes, with memory leak

- Decided to run it overnight to see if it is just slow (I don't think so though)
